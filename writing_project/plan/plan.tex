I view my writing project as having three components:

ANALYZING A DATASET IN: either risk-- environmental, disease, national security, insurance, finance OR biological/genetics related

STATISTICAL THEORY/IDEA:

COMPUTATIONAL:

As suggested by Andy, the goal of a paper as a result of my writing project. Ideally, that data set and following questions would also be driven by a ``real world" problem and the statistical theory/idea that the paper is based on will be useful in may fields.

\item Data exploration and brief look (resulting in an outline) of what statistically and computationally I could look at in my writing project for each data set
